DESCRIPTION
    String::Copyright Parses common styles of copyright statements and
    serializes in normalized format.

OPTIONS
    Options can be set as an argument to the 'use' statement.

  threshold, threshold_before, threshold_after
        use String::Copyright { threshold_after => 5 };

    Stop parsing after this many lines whithout copyright information, before
    or after having found any copyright information at all. `threshold` sets
    both `threshold_before` and `threshold_after`.

    By default unset: All lines are parsed.

  format( \&sub )
        use String::Copyright { format => \&GNU_style } };

        sub GNU_style {
            my ( $years, $owners ) = @_;

            return 'Copyright (C) ' . join '  ', $years || '', $owners || '';
        }

FUNCTIONS
    Exports one function: `copyright`. This module uses Exporter::Tiny to
    export functions, which allows for flexible import options; see the
    Exporter::Tiny documentation for details.

BUGS/CAVEATS/etc
    String::Copyright operates on strings, not bytes. Data encoded as UTF-8,
    Latin1 or other formats need to be decoded to strings before use.

    Only ASCII characters and © (copyright sign) are directly processed.

    If copyright sign is mis-detected or accents or multi-byte characters
    display wrong, then most likely the data was not decoded into a string.

    If ranges or lists of years are not tidied, then maybe it contained
    non-ASCII whitespace or digits.
